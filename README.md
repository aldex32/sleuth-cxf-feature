# CXF feature to make possible Sleuth library to work with CXF REST

## Description
Since Apache CXF is not covered out of box by Sleuth, I decided to create this CXF feature to fix it.
The only thing you need to make it work is to add this feature and Sleuth library in your project and it will work automagically ;-)

## Prerequisites
- Java 8
